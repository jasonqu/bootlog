## bootlog

a [twirl](https://github.com/playframework/twirl) static site generator inspired by [jekyllbootstrap](jekyllbootstrap.com)

use `sbt run` to build the site and check it out in `src/site`, copy them in a server such as nginx to view the site.

the theme is shamelessly forked from [fabienwang/Ghost-Flat](https://github.com/fabienwang/Ghost-Flat)
